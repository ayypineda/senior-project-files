NodeJS, Electron 


Additional Software/Equipment Needed

modern computer, access to Internet, modern browser(for testing)

Personal Motivation
-------------------

I have been a part of gaming communities on Discord that have been toxic and engaged in "doxxing" wars. My motivator was to empower those who may not know to cover all bases without having to buy subscriptions or spend thousands on specialists. Safety concerns were driving people away because they were afraid it could happen to them. 

Outline of Future Research Efforts
----------------------------------

I need to learn to use Javascript and NodeJS for the scripting. Making small components one at a time will help me connect everything.
